# Machine Learning Programming

This repository contains the exercises done in the course [Machine Learning Programming](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-programming-MICRO-401), covering the basics in the machine learning algorithms. The main purpose of this repository is to refresh my memory on the math behind the basic algorithms I use on a daily basis, reminding me how? and why?

It all has been done in MATLAB (Trust me, not my choice).

This repository will contain the exercises, as well as the data used in the labs (if possible).

Each lab contains hidden functions, that are used to evaluate the implementation. I don't think even the TAs could unlock them haha. Anyway, they are needed to run the scripts and make sure you have the right implementation and the expected result.

To be able to run the code, you simply need to use [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) & download the data used in the lab if applicable.
